    //
    // - We're potentially pointer-casting from &[i8] to &[u8]. This is fine,
    //   and there are safe APIs for this sort of thing (e.g. `bytemuck`).
    // - `as_slice` returns `&[ReadOnlyCell<T>]` instead of `&[T]`, because the
    //   slice might be mutably aliased. We're exposing &[u8] directly. This is
    //   not obviously fine, and we need to be careful.
    //
    // There are several different types of issues that `PyBuffer` (which we're
    // keeping) and `ReadOnlyCell` (which we're casting away) protect us from:
    //
    // - Someone might try to *resize* the buffer while we're reading it, making
    //   our reads UB. The `PyBuffer` "locks" the buffer to prevent this as long
    //   as we keep it alive. This slice is lifetime-bound to the `PyBuffer`
    //   once we return it, so we're ok here.
    // - We might accidentally write to this buffer ourselves, by writing to a
    //   "different" buffer that turns out to be an alias, or by running any
    //   Python code we don't control that happens to do the same thing. We
    //   won't do any writes to buffers we didn't create internally, and we
    //   won't run any Python code (even finalizers) while this slice is alive,
    //   so I think we're ok here too. (We also won't use any invariant-checking
    //   functions like `std::str::from_utf8` that could get fooled by illegal
    //   mutable aliasing.)
    // - Another thread might do the same thing, totally out of our control.
    //   In addition to problems that we can cause by doing this ourselves, this
    //   is also a *data race*, which is per se UB.
    //
    // The third problem above is the complicated one, because we need to think
    // about the GIL:
    //
    // - The GIL normally blocks other Python threads from running while our
    //   Rust code is running. That would make this whole problem go away.
    // - However, we don't *want* to block other Python threads while we hash
    //   large inputs, so like the C code in Python's `hashlib` module we
    //   release the GIL, which makes the problem come back.
    // - Even if we didn't release the GIL, other Rust extensions or C
    //   extensions might release it, and then we might race with them.
    // - Freethreaded builds of Python 3.13+ don't even have a GIL, so the
    //   question of whether anyone releases it is kind of irrelevant.
    //
    // I think the right way to think about this is to forget about the GIL and
    // just ask what happens if another thread writes to the bytes that we're
    // hashing, while we're hashing them. Clearly part of the story is that
    // we'll read and hash "junk bytes" (some unpredictable mix of before and
    // after, maybe even an "out of thin air" read under exotic circumstances).
    // That much is expected, and it's almost certainly a bug that the caller
    // need to fix on their end. But the more vexing question is, can anything
    // *else* happen? Could this data race trigger "real" UB like corrupting
    // arbitrary memory or executing an attacker's bitcoin mining virus?
    //
    // This is a thorny problem, and the relevant standards make no guarantees.
    // However, it isn't just our problem. The C implementations in Python's
    // `hashlib` have the exact same behavior, and you can trigger a real data
    // race with standard types like this:
    // https://gist.github.com/oconnor663/c69cb4dbffb9b13bbced3fe8ce2181ac.
    // This data race violates the requirements of the C memory model also.
    //
    // At the end of the day, even if this race turns out to be exploitable
    // (which I think is unlikely), only pathological programs should be able to
    // trigger it. Writing to a buffer concurrently from another thread while
    // hashing it is a very weird thing to do, and it's almost guaranteed to be
    // a correctness bug, regardless of whether it's also a soundness bug.

/// An incremental BLAKE3 hasher, which can accept any number of writes.

/// standard library.
///
/// Arguments:
/// - `data`: Input bytes to hash. Setting this to non-None is equivalent
///   to calling `update` on the returned hasher.
/// - `key`: A 32-byte key. Setting this to non-None enables the BLAKE3
///   keyed hashing mode.
/// - `derive_key_context`: A hardcoded, globally unique,
///   application-specific context string. Setting this to non-None enables
///   the BLAKE3 key derivation mode. `derive_key_context` and `key` cannot
///   be used at the same time.
/// - `max_threads`: The maximum number of threads that the implementation
///   may use for hashing. The default value is 1, meaning single-threaded.
///   `max_threads` may be any positive integer, or the value of the class
///   attribute `blake3.AUTO`, which lets the implementation use as many
///   threads as it likes. (Currently this means a number of threads equal
///   to the number of logical CPU cores, but this is not guaranteed.) The
///   actual number of threads used may be less than the maximum and may
///   change over time. API-compatible reimplementations of this library
///   may also ignore this parameter entirely, if they don't support
///   multithreading.
/// - `usedforsecurity`: Currently ignored. See the standard hashlib docs.

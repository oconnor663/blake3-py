[package]
# `name = "blake3"` is a bit confusing, because that's the same as the official
# Rust implementation that this is wrapping. However, this crate doesn't get
# published to crates.io. Instead, it gets packaged by Maturin and published on
# PyPI. Installing this with `pip install blake3` is better than something
# redundant like `pip install PyBLAKE3-py`.
